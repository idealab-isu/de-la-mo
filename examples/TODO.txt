CreateStiffenerFromLayer should take a section parameter and if given, it should add the stiffener to 
the body list to generate. 

 "bond_layers" on stiffener really perform imprint operation. 
   -> Should probably define bond_layers() to actually bond the stiffener, 
      rename imprint operation. 


02_Planar stiffener -> remove stress concentration

Cause Error if performing imprint after bonding layers
